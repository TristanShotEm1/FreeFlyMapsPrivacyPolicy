1. Information We Collect
FreeFly Maps does not collect, store, or share any personal information such as your IP address, device identifiers, or any other data that can identify you personally ‚Äî except when you voluntarily enter the GeoCache Competition (see Section 1.1 below).
The FreeFly Maps app runs primarily on your device but does transmit aggregated tapped points data‚Äîthat is, anonymized information about points you tap or interact with within the app‚Äîto third-party services including OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Google to support app functionality and improve service quality.
This tapped points data is transmitted only as anonymized, aggregated pools and is not linked to any single user or device.
1.1 GeoCache Competition Data
When you enter the in-app GeoCache Competition, we transmit certain information to our secure remote server in order to validate entries and determine eligibility. This includes:
Your full name (as provided in the entry form)
Your email address (used for winner notification and verification)
The coordinates you entered in the competition
This data is stored securely, used only for the purpose of administering the competition, and is never sold or shared outside of what is required for prize fulfillment.
2. Use of Location Data by Third-Party Services
While using FreeFly Maps, you may utilize features powered or enhanced by third-party services such as ChatGPT and Google.
These third parties may collect location data derived from your device or IP address as part of their own service operations.
Neither FreeFly Maps, ChatGPT, nor Google collect or store location data linked to any individual user for general app use. Any location or tap data collected is used solely in aggregate form to support app functionality and service improvements.
FreeFly Maps has no control over how third parties handle location data; we recommend reviewing their respective privacy policies. The FreeFly Maps app itself does not share any personal or identifiable location data directly with these services.
3. How We Use Your Information
Aggregated tapped points data: To provide core app features and improve the overall user experience.
GeoCache Competition data: To verify entries, contact winners, and fulfill prizes.
We do not process or share any other personal user data.
4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.
Data transmitted to third-party services is anonymized and aggregated (except GeoCache Competition data, which is stored securely by us for prize administration).
5. Data Retention
Aggregated tapped points data sent to third parties is managed according to their policies and is not linked back to individual users.
GeoCache Competition entry data is retained only for as long as needed to verify eligibility, award prizes, and comply with legal obligations.
6. Children‚Äôs Privacy
The FreeFly Maps app is suitable for users aged 13 and up. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. Users under 18 should obtain parental consent before entering the GeoCache Competition.
7. Your Choices and Controls

8. Security
We maintain best practices to secure both anonymized aggregated data and GeoCache Competition entry data, using encryption and restricted access controls.
