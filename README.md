FreeFly Maps ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle user information in the AirMaps app.

1. Information We Collect
We do not collect, store, or share any personal information or data from users.

Specifically:

No personal data is collected
No location data is stored or transmitted
No login or account data is required
No analytics or usage tracking is implemented
2. How We Use Your Information
Since we do not collect any information, there is no user data to process or use.
3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell, share, or disclose any user data — because we do not collect any.
4. Data Retention
No data is retained, as none is collected during your use of the app.
