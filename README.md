VRMaps Privacy Policy
Effective Date: August 2, 2025
Last Updated: August 10, 2025
VRMaps ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the VRMaps app.


1. Information We Collect
VRMaps does not collect, store, or share any personal information such as your IP address, device identifiers, or any other data that can identify you personally.
The VRMaps app runs primarily on your device but does transmit aggregated tapped points data—that is, anonymized information about points you tap or interact with within the app—to third-party services including OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Google to support app functionality and improve service quality.
This tapped points data is transmitted only as anonymized, aggregated pools and is not linked to any single user or device.
No personally identifiable information or IP addresses are transmitted or stored by VRMaps or these third-party services.
2. Use of Location Data by Third-Party Services
While using VRMaps, you may utilize features powered or enhanced by third-party services such as ChatGPT and Google.
These third parties may collect location data derived from your device or IP address as part of their own service operations.
Neither VRMaps, ChatGPT, nor Google collect or store location data linked to any individual user. Any location or tap data collected is used solely in aggregate form to support app functionality and service improvements.
VRMaps has no control over how third parties handle location data; we recommend reviewing their respective privacy policies.
The VRMaps app itself does not share any personal or identifiable location data directly with these services.
3. How We Use Your Information
VRMaps uses the aggregated tapped points data transmitted to third parties only to provide core app features and improve the overall user experience.
We do not use, process, or share any personal or identifiable user data.
All other data processing occurs locally on your device.
4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
VRMaps does not sell, share, or disclose any personal information or identifiable usage data.
Data transmitted to third-party services is anonymized and aggregated, and sharing only occurs between your device and those services.
5. Data Retention
VRMaps does not retain any personal or identifiable usage data.
Aggregated tapped points data sent to third parties is managed according to their policies and is not linked back to individual users.
6. Children’s Privacy
VRMaps does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.
The app is suitable for users of all ages without requiring personal information or account creation.
7. Your Choices and Controls
You have full control over the permissions granted to VRMaps, including location access, which can be managed via your device settings.
The app remains fully functional without granting permissions or sharing personal data.
You may choose to limit or disable permissions or data sharing at any time without affecting core app functionality.
8. Security
Since no personal or identifiable location data is collected or transmitted, and transmitted data is anonymized, the risk of data breaches related to VRMaps is minimized.
We maintain best practices in app development to ensure your device’s security and privacy.
9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in app features or legal requirements.
Updates will be posted on this page with the revised “Last Updated” date.
We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
